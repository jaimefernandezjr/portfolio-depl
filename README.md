# Personal Portfolio Automated Deployment using Terraform, Ansible, and AWS

## What is happening in this project?
1. Provisions AWS resources to prepare for deployment
2. Use Ansible to configure and install the dependencies to the provisioned AWS resources and deploy the resume
3. Used AWS Cloud9 for IDE
3. Access the deployed portfolio on http://13.212.26.100/web/ (I will start the instance upon request. I'm close to consume all of my credits in free tier😥) 
4. Access my porfolio website repository on https://github.com/jaimefernandezjr/my-portfolio-website.git
